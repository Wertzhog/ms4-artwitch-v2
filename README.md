# ArtWitch - handmade with love! v2

    This web app represents a 4th milestone project for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer course.
    This app will also be used as real world e-commerce web site later on by my friend who decide to venture into business of selling handmade product online.
    My idea was to bulid basic e-commerce site with all of the needed functionality which can later be customized with different design layouts and functionality.

(Important : Project is not finished, I decided to submit at the advice of student care. 
I am aware that project will fail at this state but I am hoping to get a chance of resubmission and hopefully gettinga a pass. I apologize for any inconvenience)
